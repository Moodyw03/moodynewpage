                Three is difficult. Not because it's unduly awkward, or even too easy, but because it messes
                around with safe notions of genre to illicit music that feels tactile and occasionally
                dangerous to the touch. <br><br>
                I don't like every track on here but the vast majority pull on strings that ignite a flush
                of emotions, especially the more atmospheric numbers such as 656f6c6863 alongside the
                industrial turmoil of You and Me, and neat contrasts served by the blissful tones of rollin'
                feat. Ylva Falk.<br> <br>
                The rugged end of funk is vigorously explored on the excellent Arrow of time Feat. B'licious
                and there are plenty of likewise pieces of music on here to firmly compliment that notion.
                Try, flashback Feat. Pleiadian sisters. Another reason to fully appreciate the spectrum of
                music Moody Waters has created is the sheer process of creative ingenuity at play
                throughout.

                I met him posting in Lobster Theremin. Lately it has been heard a lot by Release Sustain.
                <br><br>
                It doesn't matter where Moody Waters publishes, his sound goes through the hairs in our ears
                and in our heads it becomes palpable and visual. <br><br>
                Chameleon-like electronica that doesn't turn off organic arrangements ('656f6c6863'), much
                less space and robotic environments ('Music'). A proposal that sometimes sounds distant, to
                times past ('Blue Cars Go Away'), other times furiously current. <br><br>
                This is the case with 'Arrow of Time' where B'licious participates and where melodies, IDM,
                vocals and synthetic beats come together without doing the slightest damage.
                <br><br>
                In fact it turns out so. The songs that we find in 'Three' have the ability to dispel bad
                vibes to leave us calmly formatting in a relaxed zone, ideal if we light it up in purple.

                <em>Released on labels such as Release Sustain and Lobster Theremin already,
                upcoming mysterious artist Moody Waters has eyes on imprinting his mark on the
                electronic music scene through offerings of abstract, diverse sounds. Whether it's
                drowsy leftfield beats, all-out ambient moments or chugging hypnotic rollers fit for
                an Ibiza sunrise, the London-based producer isn't afraid to dip into a range of
                musical directions.</em>
                <br><br>
                <em>Now, for the first time, Moody Waters has put together an album, giving himself
                a chance to show off all of his talents through a lengthy self-released 14-track
                project. We find out how he ticks in his home studio, and what plugins went into the
                production of the debut album, Three, which you can check out below.</em>
                <br><br>
                <em><strong>Hey, Moody Waters, we're loving Three. How did the album transpire?</strong></em>
                <br><br>
                I've had the idea of recording an album for a long time now, and I really needed to get on
                it. I had the opportunity to complete a few EPs in the past, but to keep myself motivated
                creatively, I needed to work on something that featured more tracks and material than the
                typical four-tracker.
                <br><br>
                <em><strong>Can you tell us about the role Dolby Atmos played in the production of the album?</strong></em>
                <br><br>
                The company I work for, Spatial Mastering, is in the post-production industry and
                specialises in the Dolby Atmos format. And, because I am absolutely positive that this
                technology will progress the way in which we consume music, it was only natural for me to
                include Dolby Atmos and NFTs as distinct formats for the album given that I had the facility
                to do so.

                London label Lobster Theremin's latest compilation is in support of Hackney's Sistah Space.
                <br><br>
                The community initiative provides support for women and girls of African and Caribbean
                heritage who've experienced or been affected by sexual and domestic abuse. They've been
                fighting Hackney Council's order to move premises and to extend their current lease until
                March next year.
                <br><br>
                For the fourth instalment in the PLUR compilation series—the first three in which arrived on
                the inital Bandcamp no-fees Friday this past March—Lobster Theremin is donating 100 percent
                of proceeds from LOBSTER PLUR Volume 4 to Sistah Space. Angel D'lite, DJ Luz, Moody Waters,
                Elsa Hewitt, Slacker and more feature across the collection's 34 tracks. The LP was
                officially released on the August 7th Bandcamp Friday.
                <br><br>
                Sign the petition to extend Sistah Space's lease here, and support the initiative directly
                via GoFundMe. For up to the minute information on Sistah Space's fight with Hackney Council,
